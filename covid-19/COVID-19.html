		<h1 >Coronavirus</h1>
		Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br><br>
		<strong>Discovery :--</strong><mark>Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s</mark> when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). In the 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), were isolated.[9]

        <mark>Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s.</mark><br><br>

		Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br><br> Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
        Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.

        		Coronaviruses are large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface projections. The average diameter of the virus particles is around 120 nm (.12 μm). The diameter of the envelope is ~80 nm (.08 μm) and the spikes are ~20 nm (.02 μm) long. The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron dense shells.

        	<div style="font-size: 27px;background-color: #f2f2f2;width: 100%;height: 400px">The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer where the <mark>membrane (M)</mark>, <mark>envelope (E)</mark> and <mark>spike (S)</mark> structural proteins are anchored.<br><br> A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like surface protein called <mark>hemagglutinin esterase (HE)</mark><br>.

Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the <mark>nucleocapsid (N)</mark> protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome in a continuous beads-on-a-string type conformation.<br> The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.</div>
